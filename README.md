## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will provide a nice test for your layout skills. If you're ready to move up from Junior challenges, this one is a great next step.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This layout is fairly simple, most of the layout can be cmopleted by using flex-col and flex-row based on screen size, the difficult part is to have the image sized correctly for each screen width and to allow them to overlap into the sibling section.

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Tailwind css
-   Mantine UI library
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to utilise a third party ui library to create components for the landing page

### Continued development

I am going to continue using tailwind and explore Mantine UI library in more depth

### Useful resources

-   Tailwindcss Docs (https://www.tailwindcss.com)
-   Mantine UI Library (https://mantine.dev/)
